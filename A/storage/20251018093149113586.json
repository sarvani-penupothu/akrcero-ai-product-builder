  "idea_text": "Sookshma is an affordable, AI-powered portable cold-storage solution designed to help small and marginal farmers reduce post-harvest losses. The system integrates temperature, humidity, and ethylene gas sensors with a Silicon Labs microprocessor running a lightweight TinyML model to continuously monitor storage conditions.\n\nWhen the produce is at risk of spoilage, the system automatically adjusts cooling or activates ventilation\u2014ensuring optimal freshness without manual intervention. The Sookshma Tent is lightweight, energy-efficient, and cost-effective (approximately \u20b92,500 per node), making it accessible to rural communities that lack large-scale cold-chain infrastructure.\n\nBy combining IoT sensors, AI-based prediction models, and sustainable design, Sookshma empowers farmers to extend shelf life, increase income, and minimize wastage. Future versions can be solar-powered and integrated with digital dashboards for analytics and supply chain tracking.",
