  "idea_text": "Sookshma is an affordable, AI-driven portable cold-storage tent designed to help small and marginal farmers preserve their harvests effectively. It combines TinyML, sensor-based monitoring, and automated cooling control to maintain ideal temperature and humidity levels without requiring complex infrastructure.\n\nThe system uses environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, and ethylene gas) along with a compact camera to monitor produce freshness in real time. A Silicon Labs microprocessor runs a lightweight ML model directly on the device, predicting spoilage and activating cooling mechanisms automatically \u2014 ensuring zero dependency on external internet or cloud processing.\n\nAt just \u20b92500 per unit, Sookshma empowers rural farmers to minimize post-harvest losses, extend shelf life, and earn fair market value. Compact, solar-compatible, and easy to deploy anywhere from small crates to large warehouses, Sookshma brings edge intelligence to agriculture, making sustainability both affordable and accessible.",
